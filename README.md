# file_projector_with_ext
"Projects" (actually copies and removes) files and directories into another directory. It appends an extension to all file. Wonder what it could be useful for?

Configuration is currently done in the script itself. Change the folders and extension before usage.

Some cleanup and testing still necessary :)
