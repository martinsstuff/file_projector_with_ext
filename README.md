# file_projector_with_ext
"Projects" (does so by copying and removing\*) files and directories into another directory. It appends an extension to all file. Wonder what it could be useful for?

\*I wrote the program to work on Windows because symlinks for files suck there. Would be 10000 times easier on \*nix, just a tiny shell script probably.

Configuration is currently done in the script itself. Change the folders and extension before usage.

Some cleanup and testing still necessary :)
